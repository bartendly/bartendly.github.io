      <div class="terms-section-title">1. Platform Role</div>
      <p>
        Bartendly is a digital platform that connects clients and independent bartenders for private and corporate events. Bartendly does not organize, supervise, employ, or directly provide bartending services. All bookings, agreements, and responsibilities are strictly between the client and the selected bartender.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bartendly may act as a billing and payment agent on behalf of independent bartenders. By using the platform, clients and bartenders authorize Bartendly to issue invoices and collect payments for services rendered, while the legal responsibility for the service remains with the bartender.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="terms-section">
      <div class="terms-section-title">2. Liability Disclaimer</div>
      <p>
        Bartendly acts solely as an intermediary. Bartendly is not responsible or liable for any incidents, accidents, injuries, damages, losses, or disputes that may occur before, during, or after any event. All legal, financial, and practical responsibility for the event and the services provided remains with the client and the selected bartender.

    <div class="terms-section">
      <div class="terms-section-title">3. Payment & Service Quality</div>

Bartendly carefully selects and onboards independent bartenders and aims to ensure a high standard of service. In case of any issue with your booking or event, please contact Bartendly promptly, and we will make every reasonable effort to assist or resolve the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that Bartendly acts as an intermediary, and the final service contract is between the client and the bartender. Bartendly cannot be held liable for no-shows, cancellations, or dissatisfaction with the bartender's performance, but may, at its discretion, facilitate refunds or replacement bookings where possible.
