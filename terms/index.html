    <div id="scope" class="terms-section">
      <div class="terms-section-title">1) Scope &amp; Role</div>
      <p>These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern private and corporate bartending service requests and bookings made via the <b>Bartendly</b> website and related communications (including email and WhatsApp) (together, the “Service”).</p>
      <p><b>Bartendly OÜ</b> operates as a remote coordination business and acts as a <b>commercial principal</b> for the Service: Bartendly qualifies requests, defines scope, coordinates staffing and logistics, and issues quotes and invoices.</p>
      <p><b>What Bartendly is not:</b> Bartendly is <b>not an event organizer</b>, does not operate venues, and does not employ bartenders. The Service is executed on-site by <b>independent professional bartenders</b>.</p>
      <p class="terms-note">Any additional written terms stated in a specific quote/proposal, email confirmation, or invoice may supplement these Terms for that booking. If there is a conflict, the specific written booking terms prevail.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="definitions" class="terms-section">
      <div class="terms-section-title">2) Definitions</div>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Client:</b> the person or company requesting and/or booking the Service.</li>
        <li><b>Bartender:</b> an independent professional executing the Service on-site.</li>
        <li><b>Booking:</b> a confirmed engagement for a specific date, time, and location, based on an accepted quote.</li>
        <li><b>Deposit:</b> the upfront amount required to confirm a Booking, as stated in the quote/invoice (often 50% or 100%).</li>
        <li><b>Fixed Services:</b> the agreed bartending scope (e.g., staff, duration, menu scope, setup, coordination).</li>
        <li><b>Variable Costs:</b> any third-party items or purchases (e.g., ice, glassware, consumables, equipment rental, deliveries, transport) that may be required depending on the Booking and confirmed separately when applicable.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="quotes" class="terms-section">
      <div class="terms-section-title">3) Quotes &amp; Booking</div>
      <p><b>Custom pricing.</b> Each quote is tailored to the Client’s needs based on location, date/time, duration, staffing, menu scope, and any approved Variable Costs.</p>
      <p><b>How a Booking is confirmed.</b> A Booking is confirmed only when (a) the Client accepts the quote in writing (email/WhatsApp is sufficient), and (b) the Deposit (or full amount, if required) is received.</p>
      <p><b>Scope control.</b> Only the written scope in the accepted quote (and any approved written changes) is binding. Any additional requests may result in an adjusted quote.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="payments" class="terms-section">
      <div class="terms-section-title">4) Payments, Deposits &amp; Refunds</div>

      <p><b>Payment methods.</b> Payment is typically made by bank transfer to Bartendly (Wise multi-currency) and may be accepted by card where available. Payment instructions are stated on the invoice or in writing.</p>

      <p><b>Deposit rule (critical).</b> <b>Any Deposit paid is non-refundable, for all customers.</b> The Deposit compensates for commercial handling, coordination work, staffing lock, and opportunity cost.</p>

      <p><b>Balance.</b> Any remaining balance is payable according to the quote/invoice terms (typically before the event date). If a balance is not paid by the deadline, Bartendly may cancel the Booking and the Deposit remains non-refundable.</p>

      <p><b>Variable Costs.</b> Where Variable Costs apply, they must be approved by the Client in writing and are <b>100% payable upfront</b>. Once purchased, reserved, or committed, Variable Costs are <b>non-refundable</b> to the extent they are non-recoverable from suppliers/third parties.</p>

    <div id="changes-cancel" class="terms-section">
      <div class="terms-section-title">5) Changes &amp; Cancellations</div>
      <p><b>Client changes.</b> Any material change (date, time, location, guest count, staff count, scope, menu, supplies responsibility) must be requested in writing and may require a revised quote. Availability cannot be guaranteed until confirmed in writing.</p>
      <p><b>Client cancellation.</b> If the Client cancels a confirmed Booking, the Deposit remains non-refundable. Any additional amounts paid may be non-refundable depending on the timing and commitments already made (including staffing lock and approved Variable Costs), unless otherwise stated in writing.</p>
      <p><b>Bartendly cancellation.</b> If Bartendly cannot deliver the confirmed Service, Bartendly will use reasonable efforts to provide an equivalent replacement.
