      <h1>Why Bartenders Deserve Better Tools — and How Bartendly is Building Them</h1>

      <p><strong>Let’s be honest: bartenders are some of the most talented professionals in hospitality — yet way too many of us remain invisible online.</strong></p>
      <p>We bring the energy, the craft, the vibes. We turn a quiet evening into a moment guests remember. But when it comes to <strong>getting booked for events or finding cool gigs</strong> — it’s often a mess of WhatsApp groups, random DMs, or awkward emails.</p>

      <h2>💻 Time for a smarter system</h2>
      <p>At Bartendly, we believe bartenders deserve their own digital space. A place to showcase their style, get noticed, and connect with real opportunities — without relying on middlemen or platforms that don’t get our world.</p>
      <p>That’s why we’re building <strong>a commission-free platform (for now)</strong> that connects bartenders directly with private clients and bars — starting in London and Hong Kong.</p>

      <h2>🎯 What you can already do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Get featured on our public page</li>
        <li>✅ Respond to real event requests</li>
        <li>✅ Share your Instagram or WhatsApp directly</li>
        <li>✅ Keep 100% of your fee (no hidden cut)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All you need is a short bio, a photo, and your preferred contact info. We take care of the visibility.</p>

      <h2>🌍 What’s coming next</h2>
      <p>This is just the beginning. Bartendly is growing into a full platform made for you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📲 A mobile app to manage bookings</li>
        <li>🌟 Reviews and performance stats</li>
        <li>🤝 Brand deals and ambassador programs</li>
        <li>🌎 Job boards for gigs worldwide</li>
        <li>👀 More visibility than ever</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’re not here to “Uberize” the job. We’re here to make you visible, booked, and valued — on your terms.</p>

      <h2>🔑 Why now?</h2>
      <p>There’s never been a better time to reclaim your independence as a bartender. With Bartendly, you control how and when you work — and get discovered by people who respect the craft.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re looking for extra gigs, long-term roles, or just a place to show your skills — we’ve got your back.</p>

      <h2>🙋‍♂️ Want to be listed?</h2>
      <p>We’re currently welcoming new bartenders in <strong>London</strong> and <strong>Hong Kong</strong> — and opening more cities soon.</p>
